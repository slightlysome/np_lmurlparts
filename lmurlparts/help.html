A user can edit the parts and keywords for the blogs he is admin for. The blog super admin can edit global parts and keywords and the 
parts and keywords for all blogs.
</p>

<p>
In the admin area for the NP_LMURLParts plugin you first choose which blog you want to edit URL parts for. 
If you are the admin of a single blog you will autmatically choose this blog for editing URL parts. 
It you are a super admin you will also be able to choose to edit top level URL parts.
</p>

<p>
You will get a list of URL part types to choose from. After you have choosen which URL part type you want to edit 
you get a list of the defined URL parts for that type. 

This list will show the names used in your blog for the items, categorys, archives and special skinparts and the currently 
defined name to use in URLs to identify these. 
</p>

<p>
The following operations can be used on an URL part:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Edit</b> - Edit the URL part. When you change a URL part manually will it also be locked. The URL part must be URL friendly and contain 
only lowercase 7-bit letters (a-z), numbers (0-9) and the minus character. Multipart URL parts can also include / characters, and must start with a / character.
</li>
<li>
<b>Lock</b> - Locks the URL part so any updates to the names of an item, category, archive or special skinparts won't change the URL part that identifies it.
</li>
<li>
<b>UnLock</b> - Unlocks the URL part so any updates to the names of an item, category, archive or special skinparts will update the URL part that identifies it.
